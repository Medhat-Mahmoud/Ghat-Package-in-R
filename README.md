Functions are provided for quantifying evolution and selection on complex traits.
The package implements effective handling and analysis algorithms scaled for
genome-wide data and calculates a composite statistic, denoted Ghat, which is used
to test for selection on a trait. The package provides a number of simple examples
for handling and analysing the genome data and visualising the output and results.
